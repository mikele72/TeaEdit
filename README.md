# The Tea Text Editor
Tea aims to be an extensible, fast, modern text editor.

Also, more information can be found at
[hack.tea.party](https://hack.tea.party).

## Features
- Efficient, modal- and mode-based text editing
- Define-your-own text objects
- Responsive (not in the web way, in the performance way), modern, customizeable
  user interface
- Easily configurable via text files
- Easy interoperability with external tools via both key-based triggers and
  text-based interfaces (using asynchronous processing when available)
- Ease-of-use features including autocompletion, documentation support, and
  semantic highlighting.
- Fine-grained syntax highlighting control

### No plugins?
Maybe. For right now, the plan is to simply use Tea macros and external tools,
but if that proves insufficient, a plugin system will be designed.

### Other UIs?
Maybe. For right now, Tea will be focused on creating an efficient UI toolkit
based on OpenGL. However, if there is a need to decouple the core from the UI
this will be done in a way that allows for different UI implementations.
